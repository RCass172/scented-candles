# **Introduction**

Scented candles is an e-commerce website I have created for my milestone 4 project. It allows users to view the business products, which include candles and wax melts, allowing them to securly purchase any of the products online. This in turn allows the business to advertise and showcase their products and helps to increase their revenue.

[Product Information](readme/wireframes/Product-details.png)

[Manage Products](readme/wireframes/Manage-products.png)

## **Design**

For the colors I used the palette below using purples for the main content and navbar and the green for the buttons to stand out. The colors blend well together and match the overall theme of colorful candles being sold

![Color Theme](readme/images/color-theme.PNG)

I used a hero image to cover the body of the pages and it can be seen on all pages for consistancy and relevancy

For the fonts I linked GoogleFonts into the pages, using Oswald for the main text and Gwendolyn for the Logo text to stand out, as they both look well together

Once logged in as an admin user all the above features are relevant plus:

# **Testing**

Testing was carried out along the way of developing the site with fixes made throughout, along with the following tests to ensure everything was working was expected and any bugs were fixed to the best of my ability.

## **Testing the user stories**

1. To easily navigate throughout the website
    - A navbar on all pages allows easy navigation throughout all the pages with links to each page clearly stated and shown
2. To easily determine what the website is for on first inspection
    - On arriving to the homepage the user is met with the name, which clearly states what kind of products there is, and a call to action button to shop which tells the user that it is used to purchase the products

## **Testing Functionality**

- Testing was done on all the features of the website to make sure everything was working as expected. 
- Links were checked to make sure opened correctly with no broken links. External links such as the social media icons all opened in a new tab as expected. All internal links checked to make sure correct pages opened when clicked. 
- CRUD functions were tested to ensure products we easily created, read, updated and deleted as expected. 
- The checkout page was tested to make sure stripe was working to allow users to purchase products.
- Family and friends were asked to check all aspects of website to check for any errors or bugs.
Overall I was happy everything functioned as it should.
- Lighthouse was used to test each page with some accessibility errors such as button names and form labels and UI errors such as color contrasts fixed.
- Custom error pages were checked to see they displayed correctly and as expected.
- User actions were checked on all functionality of the website to ensure toast messages were displaying to users.

## **Testing Responsiveness**

- **Device testing**

The website was tested using Google Chrome's Dev Tools to check if the website displayed well on all devices below:

  1. Moto G4
  2. Galaxy S5
  3. Pixel 2
  4. Pixel 2 XL
  5. IPhone 5/SE
  6. IPhone 6/7/8
  7. IPhone 6/7/8 Plus
  8. IPhone X
  9. IPad
  10. IPad Pro
  11. Surface Duo
  12. Galaxy Fold
  13. Nest
  14. Nest Hub Max

_Results were good and as expected_

- **Operating system testing**

The website was tested on real devices with the following OS:

  1. Windows 10
  2. Android
  3. IOS

_Results were good and as expected_

- **Browser testing**

The website was tested on the following browsers:

  1. Google Chrome
  2. Microsoft Edge
  3. Opera
  4. Firefox
  5. Vivaldi

_Results were good and as expected_

## **Bugs And Fixes**

![Pillow Error](readme/images/pillow-error.PNG)

- When Pillow was installed I found myself having to install it again once Gitpod was reopened even though it was saved in the requirments.txt file. After searching on slack I found the fix [here](https://lechien73.github.io/reqfix/) which explained it was a corrupted requirements.txt from the Gitpod template I had used. Once I saved the new requirements file it worked as expected.

- I came across a Page not found (404) error when I was testing the delete function on a product. As I came to learn, this product was in my basket and once deleted it still remained in the bag due to the browser cache. Once I cleared the browser data I was able to get the site working again.

![Value Error](readme/images/Value-error.PNG)

- I got a ValueError when trying to set up the adjust and remove views in the cart. After going over the code I realised I had product_id where it should have been item_id and also, as before, a clearance of the browser data and the cart worked as expected.

- On setting up the email confirmation when a order was placed unfortunately I was unable to get the webhooks working as expected and wasn't receiving any emails to my email address once I placed an order. Looking back at Boutique Ado videos and slack channels for any fixes and not being able to get the desired results, it's a bug I have had to leave and want to fix in future updates once I develop more experience.

# **Acknowledgments**

I would like to thank Code Institute for this great learning experience along with the very helpful mentor and tutors along the way.

To my family and friends who helped provide great and honest feedback throughout the project.

And finally thank you to the slack community for whenever I got stuck on (many) a problem, research (mostly) always pointed me in the right direction.
